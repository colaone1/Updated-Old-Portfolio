### Testing Approach

This project is primarily a static portfolio site built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript for minor interactivity. As such, there is no complex business logic requiring automated unit tests.

All main functionalityâ€”including navigation, project links, contact methods, and interactive elements (such as the back-to-top button)â€”was thoroughly tested manually across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and devices (desktop and mobile).

I verified that all links work, the UI is responsive, and accessibility features (such as alt text and keyboard navigation) function as intended.

If the project were to include more advanced JavaScript logic, I would implement automated unit tests using a framework such as Jest. For future projects with more complex interactivity, I would also consider using UI testing tools like Cypress or Puppeteer.
