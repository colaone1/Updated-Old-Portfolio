# Mobile Development Server Access Guide

## 🚀 Server Status
✅ **Development server is running successfully!**

## 📱 Access from Your Phone

### Step 1: Get the Server Address
Your development server is accessible at:
- **Local IP Address**: `172.17.0.2`
- **Port**: `3000`
- **Full URL**: `http://172.17.0.2:3000`

### Step 2: Connect Your Phone
1. **Make sure your phone is on the same network** as this server
2. **Open your mobile browser** (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
3. **Enter the URL**: `http://172.17.0.2:3000`

### Step 3: Troubleshooting
If you can't access the site from your phone:

#### Option A: Try Alternative IP
Sometimes the container IP doesn't work directly. Try using the host machine's IP:
1. Find your host machine's IP address
2. Use `http://[HOST_IP]:3000` instead

#### Option B: Use a Different Tool
If live-server doesn't work, try the serve command:
```bash
npx serve . -p 3000 -s
```

#### Option C: Check Network Settings
- Ensure your phone and server are on the same WiFi network
- Some networks block inter-device communication
- Try using mobile hotspot if on restricted network

## 🔧 Server Commands

### Current Running Command

npx live-server --host=0.0.0.0 --port=3000 --no-browser

```bash
# Find and kill the process
pkill -f live-server
```

### Restart the Server
