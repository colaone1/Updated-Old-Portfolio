## ðŸŽ¯ PLANNED ENHANCEMENTS

### Graphic Design Project Card Visual Enhancement
**Status**: Planned for next session
**Priority**: High - Will significantly improve visual impact

#### **Current State:**
- Design project cards use solid color headers with icons
- Same structure as development project cards
- Functional but doesn't showcase actual design work

#### **Proposed Enhancement:**
**Replace solid color headers with actual design images**

#### **Implementation Plan:**

1. **Maintain Structural Consistency:**
   - Keep same card dimensions (600px height)
   - Preserve same layout structure (header area, content area, buttons)
   - Maintain same grid positioning and spacing
   - Keep same hover effects and transitions

2. **Design-Specific Visual Changes:**
   - **Replace header backgrounds** with actual design images:
     - CARECOVID Logo Design â†’ Use `Graphic Designs/CARECOVID Logo (1200 x 630 px).png`
     - CARECOVID Leaflet Design â†’ Use `Graphic Designs/Bitmap Leaflet for CARECOVID (1200 x 630 px).png`
     - Website Thumbnail Design â†’ Use `Graphic Designs/Website Thumbnail.png`
   - **Add dark overlay** for text readability: `background: linear-gradient(rgba(0,0,0,0.3), rgba(0,0,0,0.8))`
   - **Change text color** to white for better contrast
   - **Style buttons** with white/light colors that stand out

3. **CSS Implementation:**
   ```css
   .project-card[data-type="design"] > div:first-child {
     background-image: url('path-to-design-image');
     background-size: cover;
     background-position: center;
     position: relative;
   }
   
   .project-card[data-type="design"] > div:first-child::before {
     content: '';
     position: absolute;
     top: 0;
     left: 0;
     right: 0;
     bottom: 0;
     background: linear-gradient(rgba(0,0,0,0.3), rgba(0,0,0,0.8));
   }
   
   .project-card[data-type="design"] .project-content {
     color: white;
   }
   ```

4. **Expected Benefits:**
   - **Immediate visual impact** - Shows actual design work
   - **Professional presentation** - Design projects look like design work
   - **Better engagement** - Visitors see quality immediately
   - **Consistent branding** - Matches professional design aesthetic
   - **Maintains grid consistency** - Still looks cohesive with development projects

#### **Files to Modify:**
- `projects.html` - Update CSS and potentially HTML structure
- May need to adjust image paths and ensure proper loading

#### **Success Criteria:**
- Design project cards showcase actual work visually
- Text remains readable with proper contrast
- Grid maintains professional, consistent appearance
- Development project cards remain unchanged
- Responsive design works across all devices
