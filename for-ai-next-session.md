# AI TODO: Next Session

## Context
- The "Show More Details" feature is redundant and should be removed from the projects page.
- The "Details" button already takes users to a dedicated project page for more information.
- The goal is to have all project cards be a consistent height across all pages for a clean, professional look.

## âœ… COMPLETED: Show More Details Removal

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed all hidden `.project-details` sections** from the FriendBay and Apartment Flow project cards
2. **Updated CSS for consistent card heights**:
   - Changed `.project-card` from `min-height: 450px` to `height: 500px` for fixed height
   - Updated `.project-content-main` overflow to `hidden` to maintain consistent height
   - Increased `#projects-grid` min-height to `520px` to accommodate fixed card height
3. **No JavaScript changes needed** - no expand/collapse functionality was found in the codebase
4. **All project cards now have consistent height** for a clean, professional appearance

### Result:
- All project cards are now the same height (500px)
- Content is properly contained within the fixed height
- The "Details" button remains as the primary way to access more information
- Clean, professional appearance across all project cards

**Task completed successfully! All project cards now have consistent heights and the redundant "Show More Details" functionality has been removed.**
